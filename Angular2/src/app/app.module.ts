// Each route maps a URL path to a component
// The 3rd route specifies the route to redirect to if the path
// is empty. In our case we are redirecting to /home
// The 4th route (**) is the wildcard route. This route is used
// if the requested URL doesn't match any other routes already defined
//The order of the routes is very important.When matching routes, Angular router uses first- match wins strategy.

//declarations - Contains the components registered with this module.In our case we have two - AppComponent and EmployeeComponent
//bootstrap - Contains the root component that Angular creates and inserts into the index.html host web page
